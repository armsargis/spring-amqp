  <title>Spring Integration AMQP Support</title>

  <section id="spring-integration-amqp-introduction">
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>The <ulink url="http://springsource.org/spring-integration">Spring Integration</ulink> project
      includes AMQP Channel Adapters and Gateways that build upon the Spring AMQP project. Those adapters are developed and released in the
      Spring Integration project.
      In Spring Integration, "Channel Adapters" are unidirectional (one-way) whereas "Gateways" are
      bidirectional (request-reply). We provide an inbound-channel-adapter,
      outbound-channel-adapter, inbound-gateway, and outbound-gateway.</para>

    <para>Since the AMQP adapters are part of the Spring Integration
    release, the documentation will be available as part of the Spring
    Integration distribution. As a taster, we just provide a quick
    overview of the main features here.</para>

    <title>Inbound Channel Adapter</title>

    <para>To receive AMQP Messages from a Queue, configure an &lt;inbound-channel-adapter&gt;</para>

    <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<amqp:inbound-channel-adapter channel="fromAMQP"
                              queue-names="some.queue"
                              connection-factory="rabbitConnectionFactory"/>]]></programlisting>

  <section>
    <title>Outbound Channel Adapter</title>

    <para>To send AMQP Messages to an Exchange, configure an &lt;outbound-channel-adapter&gt;.
      A 'routing-key' may optionally be provided in addition to the exchange name.</para>

    <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<amqp:outbound-channel-adapter channel="toAMQP"
                               exchange-name="some.exchange"

  <section>
    <title>Inbound Gateway</title>

    <para>To receive an AMQP Message from a Queue, and respond to its
    reply-to address, configure an &lt;inbound-gateway&gt;.</para>

    <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<amqp:inbound-gateway request-channel="fromAMQP"
                               reply-channel="toAMQP"

  <section>
    <title>Outbound Gateway</title>

    <para>To send AMQP Messages to an Exchange and receive back a
    response from a remote client, configure an
    &lt;outbound-gateway&gt;.  A 'routing-key' may optionally be
    provided in addition to the exchange name.</para>

    <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<amqp:outbound-gateway request-channel="toAMQP"
                               reply-channel="fromAMQP"
