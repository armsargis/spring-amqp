  <para>
    For those who are not familiar with AMQP, the
    <ulink url="http://www.amqp.org/confluence/display/AMQP/AMQP+Specification">specification</ulink>
    is actually quite readable. It is of course the authoritative source of information, and the Spring
    AMQP code should be very easy to understand for anyone who is familiar with the spec. Our current
    implementation of the RabbitMQ support is based on their 2.8.x version, and it officially supports
    AMQP 0.8 and 0.9.1. We recommend reading the 0.9.1 document.

  <para>
    There are many great articles, presentations, and blogs available on the
    RabbitMQ <ulink url="http://www.rabbitmq.com/how.html">Getting Started</ulink> page.
    Since that is currently the only supported implementation for Spring AMQP, we also
    recommend that as a general starting point for all broker-related concerns.

    Finally, be sure to visit the Spring AMQP
    <ulink url="http://forum.springsource.org/forumdisplay.php?f=74">Forum</ulink> if you have questions
          or suggestions. With this first GA release, we are looking forward to a lot of community feedback!
